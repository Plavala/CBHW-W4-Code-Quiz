# CBHW-W4-Code-Quiz
We are tasked to create a 10 question quiz with a timer.

## Description
For our fourth homework we were tasked to create a timed 10 question quiz of our own subject. The timer would keep going until it hits zero. Every question wrong would take time off as punishment. At the end we get a score depending on how many answers we answered right. We can submit our scores and compare them to other players and clear the scoreboard if we want to. My test is about bartending and cocktail recipes. Took the inspiration beauce i am currently a bartender and love mixology. 


*Here is an example of what that page looks like.*
